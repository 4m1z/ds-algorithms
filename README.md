# Data Structures And Algorithms

> Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
<em>Rob Pike</em>

This repository is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages, including TypeScript, Go and Rust. The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive learning resource for anyone interested in mastering algorithms and data structures, with a focus on ensuring that you never forget what you learn.

The code in this repository is designed to help you learn algorithms in a way that sticks. Each algorithm is implemented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed explanations and comments provided throughout the code. Additionally, each problem includes a set of test cases to help you verify that your solution is correct and to reinforce your understanding of the underlying algorithm.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository is a great resource for learning and improving your skills in data structures and algorithms. By studying and practicing the code in this repository, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how algorithms work, and be able to apply them to a wide range of programming problems.

So, if you're looking to improve your understanding of data structures and algorithms in different programming languages and want to ensure that you truly understand what you learn, this repository is the perfect place to start.
