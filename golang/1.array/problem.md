#problem-9
class-photos: 
Given two array lists that represent the height of the students.
the first array belongs to students with red shirts, the second 
array represents students with blue shirts. all heights are 
non-zero and positive integers, heights are not necessarily unique.
The number of students with red and blue shirts is equal.
Is possible to  take a photo of students in the class with the following constraints?
all of the students with red shirts must be in the same row. 
all of the students with blue shirts must be in the same row.
our photo must have exactly 2 rows and these 2 rows must have 
the same number of students in them. 
every student that is in the front row must be strictly shorter than all students in the back row.
