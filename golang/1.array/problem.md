# Arrays Problems Description

### Problem #1 

**Description:** You have a list of positive numbers, and you need to find two numbers in the list that add up to a given target number.

**Example:** If you have a list of [2, 7, 11, 15] and the target is 9, you need to find the first two numbers (2 and 7) because 2 + 7 = 9.

### Problem #2

**Description:** You have a list of vertical lines on a chart (represented by their heights), and you want to find two lines that, when combined with the x-axis, create a container that holds the most water.

**Example:** Given the heights [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7], the two lines with heights 8 and 7 would create the largest container, holding a total of 7 units of water.

### Problem #3
( max-area ) 

**Description:** You have a list of rectangles, each with a height of 1, and you want to determine how much water can be trapped within these rectangles.

**Example:** If you have a sequence of rectangles with heights [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1], you can trap a total of 6 units of water within them.

### Problem #5

**Description:** Determine whether a given sequence of numbers (subsequence) can be derived from a larger sequence by deleting some or none of the items without changing their order.

**Example:** If you have the main sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and the subsequence [2, 4, 6], the subsequence is valid because you can get it by removing the elements 1, 3, and 5 from the main sequence.

---

### Problem #6

**Description:** You have an array of sorted integers that are the squares of other integers. Find this sorted array.

**Example:** Given the sorted squared array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], these are the squares of the integers [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

### Problem #7

(non-constructible change)

**Description:** Find the smallest amount of change that cannot be created using a given set of coin denominations.

**Example:** If the coin denominations are [1, 2, 5], the smallest amount of change that cannot be created is 4, as you cannot make 4 cents using these coins.

---

### Problem #8

**minimum waiting time problem**

**Description:** Given an array of query execution times, find the minimum waiting time required to execute all the queries.

**Example:** If you have queries with execution times [5, 1, 3, 2], the minimum waiting time to execute all of them efficiently would be 10 units of time.

---

### Problem #9

***class photos***

**Description:** Determine if it is possible to take a photo of students with red and blue shirts with specific constraints on row arrangements and heights.

**Example:** If you have two arrays of student heights with red and blue shirts and they can be arranged in two rows with red shorter than blue in the front row, you can take the photo.

---

### Problem #10

**Description:** Given arrays representing the speeds of bicycle riders with red and blue shirts, find the maximum or minimum speed of tandem bicycles (one red shirt and one blue shirt rider on each bicycle) based on the specified criteria.

**Example:** If you want to find the maximum speed of tandem bicycles and you have red shirt speeds [5, 3, 9] and blue shirt speeds [6, 2, 8], the maximum speed is 9 (from pairing 9 with 2).

### Problem #14
(dp)

**Description:** Given a staircase where each step has a non-negative cost, and you can climb one or two steps at a time, find the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase.

**Example:** If the costs of the steps are [10, 15, 20], the minimum cost to reach the top is 15, achieved by taking the first and third steps.

### Problem 41: Knight's Probability on Chessboard

**Description:** A knight on an nxn chessboard makes k random moves (8 possible directions). You need to find the probability that the knight is still on the chessboard after k moves.

**Example:** If the knight starts at (0, 0) on a 3x3 chessboard and makes 2 random moves, there is a certain probability that it remains on the chessboard. Calculating this probability is the goal of this problem.

### Problem 42: 

**Description:** Given a 2D array with rooms represented by empty spaces, walls, and gates, you need to fill each empty room with the number of steps required to reach the nearest gate. If a room cannot be reached from any gate, it remains with an unreachable value (e.g., INF).

**Example:** Given a 4x4 grid with gates (G), empty rooms (E), and walls (W):

```
G  E  G  W
W  W  E  W
G  W  W  W
W  E  E  G
```

After processing, the grid might look like:

```
G  0  G  W
W  W  1  W
G  2  1  1
W  1  0  G
```
