###problems description

1. Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. 
Maximum depth is the number of nodes along the
longest path from the root node to the furthest
leaf node

2. Given a binary tree, return the level order of
traversal of the node's values as an array. 

3. Given a binary tree and imagine you're standing
to the right of the tree, return an array of the values
of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom . 

4. Given a complete binary tree, count the number of
nodes

5. Given a tree detect that is binary search tree or not;

6. Given a binary search tree and a number that is not 
in the binary tree that you got... find the closest value
in the tree.


7. sum of branches 
8. sum of node depths
