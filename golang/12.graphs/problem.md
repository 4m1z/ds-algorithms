#problem-5
  There are N label nodes labelled 1 to N.
  Given a times array,containing edges represented by array 
  [u,v,w] where u is the source node, v is the target node 
  and w is the time taken to travel from the source node to 
  the target node.
  send a signal from node k, return how long it takes for  
  all nodes to receive a signal, return -1 if it's impossible.
