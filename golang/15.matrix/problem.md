     bfs traverse in matrix


###problem-1 : 
     Given a matrix which contains 1's and 0's,each 1 
     indicates the lands and each 0 indicates water. 
     count the number of islands. 
     island: is a land connected horizontal or vertical

###problem-2 :
     Given a 2D array containing 0's (empty cell),
     1's (fresh orange) and 2's (rotten orange).
     Every minute, all fresh oranges immediately
     adjacent (4 directions) to rotten oranges will rot.
     How many minutes must pass until all oranges are
     rotten

###problem-3 :
    Given a 2d array containing -1( walls ) , 0's 
    (gates),and INF's (empty room). Fill each empty 
    room with the number of steps to the nearest 
    gate.if it's impossible to reach to a gate, leave
    INF as the value.INF is equal to 2147483647

###problem-4 :
   on a given nxn chessboard, a knight piece will 
   start at the r-th row and c-th column. The knight
   will attempt to make ke moves. 
   A knight can move in 8 possible ways. Each move 
   will choose one of these 8 at random. The Knight
   continues moving until it finishes k moves or it 
   moves off the chessboard. Return the probability 
   that the knight is on the chessboard after it 
   finishes moving.
