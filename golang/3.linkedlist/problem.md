## Problem 1: Design API for Linked List

In this problem, you are tasked with designing an API (Application Programming Interface) for a linked list. The API should include operations like adding elements to the list, deleting elements, searching for elements, and other common linked list operations. Here's a basic example of how the API might be used:

## Problem 2: Reverse a Given Linked List

You are given a linked list, and your task is to reverse the order of its elements. Here's an example:

Input Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output Linked List: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

## Problem 4: Reverse a Part of Linked List

Given a linked list and two indices `m` and `n`, you need to reverse the elements of the linked list from position `m` to position `n`. Here's an example:

Input Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
m = 2, n = 4
Output Linked List: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5

## Problem 5: Remove Duplicate Elements in Linked List

You are given a linked list that may contain duplicate elements. Your task is to remove all duplicate elements, leaving only distinct values in the linked list. Here's an example:

Input Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5
Output Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5




## Problem 6: Remove the K'th last node from a linked list 




## Problem 7: linked list intersection 


## Problem 8: LRU Cache
