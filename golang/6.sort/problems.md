### Problem 1: Quick Sort

**Description:**  
Quick Sort üöÄ is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

**Usage:**  
Quick Sort is widely used for general-purpose sorting because of its average-case efficiency and ability to handle large datasets effectively.

**Test Case:**  
- **Input:** `[4, 2, 9, 6, 23, 12, 34, 0]`  
- **Output:** `[0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 23, 34]`

### Problem 2: Find Kth Largest Element

**Description:**  
Given an unsorted array, find the kth largest element üéØ in sorted order, not necessarily distinct. This problem is often solved using various sorting algorithms or specialized techniques.

**Usage:**  
Finding the kth largest element is commonly used in scenarios like competitive programming, statistical analysis, and real-time applications like leaderboards.

**Test Case:**  
- **Input:** `[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`, `k = 3`  
- **Output:** `3` (The 3rd largest element in sorted order is `3`)

### Problem 3: Bubble Sort

**Description:**  
Bubble Sort üíß is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

**Usage:**  
Bubble Sort is typically used for educational purposes to teach sorting concepts due to its simplicity, though it is less efficient for large datasets.

**Test Case:**  
- **Input:** `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`  
- **Output:** `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`

### Problem 4: Insertion Sort

**Description:**  
Insertion Sort ‚úèÔ∏è is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through each element and 'inserts' it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

**Usage:**  
Insertion Sort is most effective for small datasets or nearly sorted data due to its simplicity and efficiency in such cases.

**Test Case:**  
- **Input:** `[7, 3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`  
- **Output:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`

### Problem 5: Merge Sort

**Description:**  
Merge Sort üîó is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.

**Usage:**  
Merge Sort is widely used in applications requiring stable sorting and for datasets too large to fit into memory, as it is suitable for external sorting.

**Test Case:**  
- **Input:** `[6, 2, 8, 4, 1, 9, 3, 7]`  
- **Output:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
