## Implementing a Max Heap

A max heap is a binary tree where the parent nodes have values greater than or equal to their children. The root node contains the maximum value in the heap. To implement a max heap, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Data Structure**: You can use an array to represent the max heap. The first element (at index 0) will be the root of the heap.

2. **Insertion Operation**: When inserting an element, add it to the end of the array and then "bubble up" the element by repeatedly comparing it with its parent. Swap it with the parent if it's larger, and continue until the max heap property is restored.

3. **Deletion Operation (Extract Max)**: To remove the maximum element, which is the root, swap it with the last element in the array and then "sink down" the element by comparing it with its children. Swap it with the larger child until the max heap property is restored.

4. **Peek Operation**: To retrieve the maximum element without removing it, simply return the element at index 0.

5. **Building a Max Heap**: You can build a max heap from an unsorted array by starting from the last non-leaf node (parent of the last element) and applying the sink-down operation on each node in reverse order.

## Implementing a Min Heap

A min heap is similar to a max heap, but the parent nodes have values less than or equal to their children. The root node contains the minimum value in the heap. To implement a min heap, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Data Structure**: Use an array to represent the min heap, with the smallest element at the root (index 0).

2. **Insertion Operation**: When inserting an element, add it to the end of the array and "bubble up" the element by repeatedly comparing it with its parent. Swap it with the parent if it's smaller, and continue until the min heap property is restored.

3. **Deletion Operation (Extract Min)**: To remove the minimum element (root), swap it with the last element in the array and then "sink down" the element by comparing it with its children. Swap it with the smaller child until the min heap property is restored.

4. **Peek Operation**: To retrieve the minimum element without removing it, return the element at index 0.

5. **Building a Min Heap**: You can build a min heap from an unsorted array by starting from the last non-leaf node (parent of the last element) and applying the sink-down operation on each node in reverse order.

Implementing max and min heaps involves similar principles, but the comparison directions (greater or smaller) are reversed. The operations ensure that the heap properties are maintained during insertion and deletion, allowing for efficient retrieval of the maximum or minimum element.
