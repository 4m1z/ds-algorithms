## Problem 1: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

**Description:** Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node to the furthest leaf node.

**Example:**
For the binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
The maximum depth is 3.

## Problem 2: Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree

**Description:** Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of the node values as an array. Level order traversal means visiting nodes level by level, from left to right.

**Example:**
For the binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
The level order traversal is `[3, 9, 20, 15, 7]`.

## Problem 3: Right View of Binary Tree

**Description:** Given a binary tree, imagine you're standing to the right of the tree. Return an array of the values of the nodes you can see, ordered from top to bottom.

**Example:**
For the binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
The right view is `[3, 20, 7]`.

## Problem 4: Count Nodes in Complete Binary Tree

**Description:** Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in the tree efficiently.

**Example:** If the complete binary tree has 7 nodes, you should return 7.

## Problem 5: Check Binary Search Tree

**Description:** Given a binary tree, determine whether it is a binary search tree (BST) or not. A binary search tree is a tree in which all left descendants of a node are less than or equal to the node, and all right descendants are greater than or equal to the node.

**Example:**
For the binary tree:
```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```
It is a BST.

## Problem 6: Find Closest Value in BST

**Description:** Given a binary search tree and a number that is not in the tree, find the closest value in the tree to the given number.

**Example:** For the BST:
```
    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3
```
If the target number is 3.5, the closest value is 4.

## Problem 7: Sum of Branches in Binary Tree

**Description:** Find the sum of all branches in a binary tree. A branch is a path from the root to a leaf node.

## Problem 8: Sum of Node Depths in Binary Tree

**Description:** Calculate the sum of the depths of all nodes in a binary tree. The depth of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root to that node.

## Problem 9: Compare Two Binary Trees

**Description:** Compare two binary trees and determine if they are identical or not. Two trees are identical if they have the same structure and the same node values.
