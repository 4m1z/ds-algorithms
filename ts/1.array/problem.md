###  Problem #1
you are given an array of positive numbers .
find the indexes of two numbers that is equal to the target value
that will be provided by the test cases

### Problem #2
you are given an array of positive numbers
which each number represents height of a vertical line
on a chart . find two lines which together with the x-axis
forms a container that will hold the greatest amount of water
return the area of the water that would hold

### Problem #3
you are given an array of positive numbers which each number indicates the height
of a rectangle with width of width 1 on a horizontal vector, then find out how much water
can trap in.

### Problem #4
For given a staircase, the i-th step is assigned a non negative
cost indicates by a cost array.
Once you pay cost for the step.you can either climb one or two  
 steps. find the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase.
Your first step can either be the first or second step

### Problem #5
validate subsequence

### Problem #6
squared sorted array

### Problem #7
non constructible change

### Problem #8
finding minimum waiting time for query execution:
Given an array of positive numbers each number
indicates the time that query needs to be executed
find the minimum waiting time to execute all the query.

### Problem #9

class-photos:
Given two array lists that represent the height of the students.
the first array belongs to students with red shirts, the second
array represents students with blue shirts. all heights are
non-zero and positive integers, heights are not necessarily unique.
The number of students with red and blue shirts is equal.
Is possible to take a photo of students in the class with the following constraints?
all of the students with red shirts must be in the same row.
all of the students with blue shirts must be in the same row.
our photo must have exactly 2 rows and these 2 rows must have
the same number of students in them.
every student that is in the front row must be strictly shorter than all students in the back row.

### Problem #10
Tandem Bicycle:
Given two array lists as input that represents speeds of
bicycle rider with red and blue shirts.
the third input indicates that we are looking for tandem
bicycle with the max speed and if the value of the third
argument is false, we are looking for the min speed rider.
each tandem bicycle has 2 rider one blue and one red shirt
rider.
